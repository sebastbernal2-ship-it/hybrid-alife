# Continuation handoff: hybrid-alife

Purpose: a new session with zero context can continue this project without
re-deriving state. This file is the checkpoint owner. Deeper detail lives in the
result documents it points to.

## Where things stand

- Repository: https://github.com/sebastbernal2-ship-it/hybrid-alife
- `main` merged state: `9188831` (PR #16), with this handoff committed on top.
- Working tree clean, tests pass (369 at the checkpoint), CI green on Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- Research question and claim boundary: `docs/RESEARCH_ALIGNMENT.md`
- Ranked directions and accumulated lessons: `docs/GRAVITY_ROADMAP.md`
- Project memory and sharp edges: `AGENTS.md`

## Results on main

| Direction | Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Calibration end to end | 5/5 seeds, worst direction +9.94, mean +10.85 | `docs/results/gravity_study_v1/` |
| Simulator internal estimate | 5/5 seeds, worst direction +10.06, mean +10.92 | same |
| Independent HiperGator replication | passed, exact per-seed agreement | `docs/results/gravity_study_v1/REPLICATION.md` |
| D2 reversal adaptation | one-step recovery, frozen control never adapts | `docs/results/reversal_adaptation/` |
| D4 revelation forms | positive, channel-ordered, false ones self-correct | `docs/results/revelation_forms/` |
| D1 evolved embodied | negative pilot, plumbing fixed, claim open | `docs/results/embodied_law_pilot/` |
| D1 proprioception | negative, 0/5 seeds at every budget tried | `docs/results/embodied_law_proprioception/` |

The three studies reproduce with:

```

## Next bounded package: D1 search lever (captain decision)

The proprioception package is merged and negative. The reward plumbing is
verified; the limiter is evolutionary search. Selection only mutates dead slots,
so the surviving elite freezes. That is why 20 generations equal 8. Evidence in
`docs/results/embodied_law_proprioception/README.md`.

Three candidate levers, cheapest first. The captain picks one before work starts:

1. **Policy-gradient update on the embodied controller.** Reuse the
   reward-weighted-regression or actor-critic pattern already used for the point
   organism, and test whether a gradient can move the embodied policy at all.
2. **Mutate survivors.** Stop freezing the elite: apply mutation to every slot
   each generation, and check whether the population escapes the fixed action
   bias.
3. **Expressive controller.** Replace the GRU with a form that can express the
   inferred-flow mapping directly, then ask whether evolution finds its weights.

Every lever keeps the same gate: per-direction held-out alignment beats the
initial-population control by `0.2`, and the reversed-law alignment is at most
`0.0`. State the budget before the run. Report a negative result rather than
enlarging the budget silently.

## Constraints and traps learned the hard way

- Run locally with `JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`. The suite takes about 10 to 15 minutes; CI has a 35-minute job ceiling.
- Keep decisive gate tests small and put full-size training runs in `scripts/`.
- Never report a mean across gravity directions as the primary result. Gate on the minimum across directions.
- Never average signed alignment across antipodal directions; it cancels to zero.
- Avoid reward designs with an isolated optimum. That needle looked like a learner failure and was not.
- Prefer continuous actions over a small discrete set when direction is the target, to avoid a mode-versus-mean failure.
- Two silent plumbing bugs already cost a day in D1: no births meant no mutation, and evaluation resurrected only the elite half of the population. Always verify the control baseline actually differs from the treatment.
- The embodied selection scheme only mutates dead slots. Once one clone dominates, survivors freeze and later generations change nothing. Do not assume a longer run explores more.
- A gate can pass by accident if the metric tracks the imposed direction's sign rather than a learned response. Always include the reversed-law control.
- HiperGator access uses a persistent ControlMaster socket at `~/.ssh/hpg-%r@%h:%p`; plain `ssh hipergator` reuses it. If it prompts, reconnect interactively once.

## Open decisions

- The PPO-POET archive claim stays closed as `insufficient_evidence` unless the
  captain reopens it deliberately.
- Any claim about consciousness, sentience, or symbolic representation is out of
  scope for this study and must not be inferred from these results.

## Earlier history

Older campaign handoffs and field-discovery history were superseded by the
results above. The archived artifacts remain under `docs/results/`, including
`poet_campaign_final_v6/` and the field-discovery pilots.
